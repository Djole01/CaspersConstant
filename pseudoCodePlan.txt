   pseudo code plan I had of this program, written on my phone.

		Main ( )
		{
		Cout Enter 3 or 4 digit number, with at least 2 different values (including 0)

		number1 = cin:
		Int length = number1 length

		If ( length > 4 || length < 3 )
		{ error, go to cin again}
		Else if ( not at least 2 unique numbers)
		{ error, go to cin again}

		If (length == 3)
		 { math operation until constant is reached,
		Printf / cout every line of calculation}
		If (length == 4)
		 { math operation until constant is reached
		Printf / cout every line of calculation}

		}

		Math operation function 4 digit (number1)
		{

		 Sort
		Subtract
		Compare to previous , if same,  stop, if not
		Goto sort again.

		}

		Math operation function 3 digit (number1)

		{

		 Sort
		Subtract
		Compare to previous , if same,  stop, if not
		Goto sort again

		}
