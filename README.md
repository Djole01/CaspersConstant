# Casper's Constant
Work in progress!

A c++ representation of the mathematical phenomena called "Casper's Constant". 

The mathematics goes as follows:
    1 - Take a 3 or 4 digit number, with at least 2 unique digits (including 0).
    2 - Sort the number by biggest digits descending and by smallest digits ascending (4321   and  1234).
    3 - Substract the bigger number by the smaller (4321 - 1234), get the next number.
    4 - Repeat steps 1-3, until the next number results in the same value as the previous (becomes constant).
    5 - That number is Casper's Constant.


My program asks the input from the user. 
It has to be an integer, with the following requirements: 3 or 4 digits long, and has to have 2 unqiue digits.
These are the requirements to get the constant of the mathematical phenoma.
